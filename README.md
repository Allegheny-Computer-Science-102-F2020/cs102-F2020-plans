## Introduction

This repository contains all of the course planning documents for Computer
Science 102 Fall 2020, Discrete Structures. This course introduces the
mathematical foundations of Computer Science, ensuring that students can
effectively create and manipulate discrete objects in a Python programming
environment. More details about the course are available in the [course
syllabus](https://github.com/Allegheny-Computer-Science-102-F2020/cs102-F2020-syllabus).
A collection of slides for each week of the course is also available in the
[course
slides](https://github.com/Allegheny-Computer-Science-102-F2020/cs102-F2020-slides)
repository.

## Course Description

An introduction to the foundations of computer science with an emphasis on
understanding the abstract structures used to represent discrete objects.
Participating in hands-on activities that often require teamwork, students
learn the computational methods and logical principles that they need to create
and manipulate discrete objects in a programming environment. Students also
learn how to write, organize, and document a programâ€™s source code so that it
is easily accessible to intended users of varied backgrounds. During a weekly
laboratory session students use state-of-the-art technology to complete
projects, reporting on their results through both written documents and oral
presentations. Students are invited to use their own [departmentally approved
laptop](https://www.cs.allegheny.edu/resources/laptops/) in this course; a
limited number of laptops are available for use during class and lab sessions.
