# Laboratory Assignments

- **Assigned**: At the start of a remote laboratory session every Monday
- **Due**: At the start of the remote laboratory session one week after it was assigned

Building on material in the textbooks and the content covered during the
following weeks of the semester, laboratory assignments have the following
goals:

- Equip a learner to solve new problems in the field of discrete structures by
  applying in a new way your knowledge of the facts, techniques, and rules of
  discrete mathematics and Python programming.

- Afford a learner the opportunity to compare and contrast implementations of
  discrete structures in Python, enabling you to find evidence to support
  appropriate generalizations and simplifications.

- Enable a learner to develop the skills needed conduct experiments and use
  experimental results to present and defend judgements about the efficiency,
  effectiveness, and correctness of discrete structures implemented in Python.
