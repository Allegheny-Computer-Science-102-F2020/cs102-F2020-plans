# Laboratory Assignments

- **Assigned**: At the start of a remote laboratory session every Monday
- **Due**: At the start of the remote laboratory session one week after it was assigned

Building on material in the textbooks and the content covered during the
following weeks of the semester, laboratory assignments have the following
goals:

- Equip a learner to solve new problems in the field of discrete structures by
  applying in a novel way your knowledge of the facts, techniques, and rules of
  discrete mathematics and Python programming.

- Afford a learner the opportunity to compare and contrast implementations of
  discrete structures in Python, enabling you to find evidence to support
  both the generalization and specialization of a structure.

- Enable a learner to develop the skills needed conduct experiments and use
  experimental results to present and defend judgements about the efficiency,
  effectiveness, and correctness of discrete structures implemented in Python.

Using the Python functions in a textbook as a starting point, laboratory
assignments invite you to complete tasks like the following:

- Use a text editor and a terminal window to design, implement, test, and use a
  new Python function, recording its output when provided with different inputs
  and explaining why you decided to implement it in the chosen fashion.

- After using a text editor and a terminal window to refactor the implementation
  of a Python function to ensure that it strikes the right balance between
  understandability, generalizability, and specialization, justify and
  reflectively examine your decisions in technical writing.

- Use a text editor and a terminal window to design, implement, test, and use an
  experimentation framework to run experiments to evaluate the Python function.
  Using the data collected from the experiments, evaluate the implementation of
  the Python function as you consider, for instance, its efficiency and
  correctness.

- After using a text editor and a terminal window to design, implement, test,
  and use an integrated Python program that features user documentation, a test
  suite, and either a command-line or web-based interface, critique the quality
  of the program based on pre-defined criteria.
