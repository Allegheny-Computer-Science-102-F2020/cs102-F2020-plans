# Practical Assignments

- **Assigned**: At the start of a remote practical session every Friday
- **Due**: At the start of the remote practical session one week after it was assigned

Building on material in the textbooks and the content covered during that week's
in-person classroom session, practical assignments have the following goals:

- Allow a learner to demonstrate an understanding of facts and ideas by translating,
  interpreting, and stating the main technical ideas presented in the textbooks.

- Equip a learner to solve new problems in the field of discrete structures by
  applying &mdash; in a new way &mdash; their knowledge of the facts, techniques,
  and rules of discrete mathematics and Python programming.

Building on the Python functions in the textbooks, practical assignments invite
you to complete tasks like the following:

- Use a text editor and a terminal window to design, implement, and use a new
  Python function, recording its output when provided with different inputs and
  explaining why you decided to implement it in the chosen fashion.

- Use a text editor and a terminal window to write and execute test cases for a
  new Python function, recording its output when provided with different inputs
  and explaining why you decided to implement it in the chosen fashion.

- Use a text editor and a terminal window to write and execute test cases for a
  new Python function, recording the pass or fail status of each test as it
  provides the function under test with different inputs, explaining why you
  decided to implement it in the chosen fashion.
