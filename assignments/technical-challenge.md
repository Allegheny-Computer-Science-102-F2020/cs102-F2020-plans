# Technical Challenges

- **Assigned**: Immediately after your assigned in-person classroom session
- **Due**: At the start of the in-person classroom session one week after it was assigned

Building on material in the textbooks and the content covered during that day's
in-person classroom session, technical challenges have the following goals:

- Help a learner to demonstrate that you can remember learned material by recalling
  facts, basic concepts, and answers to questions presented in the textbooks.

- Allow a learner to demonstrate an understanding of facts and ideas by translating,
  interpreting, and stating the main technical ideas presented in the textbooks.

Technical challenges invite you to complete tasks like the following:

- Use a text editor and a terminal window to implement one of the Python
  functions in a textbook, recording its output when provided with different
  inputs and explaining why it is implemented in that fashion.

- Use a text editor and a terminal window to modify the provided implementation
  of a Python function from a textbook, explaining both your modification's
  impact on the original function and the output of the modified function.

- Use a text editor and a terminal window to combine multiple Python functions
  from the textbooks into a unified Python function, explaining both how you
  combined the functions and the output of the combined function.
