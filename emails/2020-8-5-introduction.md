Hello CMPSC 102 Students,

At the outset, you should know that I am writing this email to all of the
students who are either registered for the course or who are on the waiting list
for the course. Please know that it is very likely that I will be able to add
all (or at least the majority) of the students in the course to the official
course roster on the first day of classes, August 31, 2020.
