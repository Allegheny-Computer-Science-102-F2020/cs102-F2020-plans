Hello CMPSC 102 Students,

At the outset, you should know that I am writing this email to all of the
students who are either registered for the course or who are on the waiting list
for the course. Please know that it is very likely that I will be able to add
all (or at least the majority) of the students on the waiting list to the
official course roster on the first day of classes, August 31, 2020.

Since I want you to stay up-to-date with the planning for our course, I
encourage you to visit the following GitHub repository for more details:

https://github.com/Allegheny-Computer-Science-102-F2020/cs102-F2020-plans

Even if you do not yet have a GitHub account, you will be able to follow along
in your web browser to see the planning that I am doing for the CMPSC 102
course.

Since I also want you to be able to easily communicate with me and the other
students who will be in the course, I have also setup a Slack workspace. You can
sign-up to join the Slack workspace for free at this web site:

https://join.slack.com/t/cmpsc102fall2020/signup

If you are not sure how to visit the planning site on GitHub or to signup to our
Slack workspace, you can reply to this email with your questions. If you get
stuck on a certain step, don't worry, I will be glad to help!
