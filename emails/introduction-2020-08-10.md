Hello CMPSC 102 Students,

## Introduction

At the outset, you should know that I am writing this email to all of the
students who are either registered for the course or who are on the waiting list
for the course. Please understand that it is very likely that I will be able to
add all (or at least the majority) of the students on the waiting list to the
official course roster on the first day of classes, August 31, 2020.

Since I want you to stay up-to-date with the planning for our course, I
encourage you to visit the following GitHub repository for more details:

https://github.com/Allegheny-Computer-Science-102-F2020/cs102-F2020-plans

Even if you do not yet have a GitHub account, you will be able to follow along
in your web browser to see the planning that I am doing for the CMPSC 102
course.

Since I also want you to be able to easily communicate with me and the other
students who will be in the course, I have also setup a Slack workspace. You can
sign-up to join the Slack workspace for free at this web site:

https://join.slack.com/t/cmpsc102fall2020/signup

If you are not sure how to visit the planning site on GitHub or to signup to our
Slack workspace, you can reply to this email with your questions. If you get
stuck on a certain step, don't worry, I will be glad to help!

## Remote Learning

Before I start to explain the details of this course and the way in which I will
teach it, I want to be upfront about the fact that some learning activities that
you will participate in this semester will involve remote interactions. With
that said, I'm confident that you will receive a top-notch introduction to
Discrete Structures through these remote learning opportunities! I also want to
stress that learning how to work in a remote fashion will make you more
competitive for securing a position at a technology company. If you have any
questions about remote learning, I hope that you will ask them in a public
channel in Slack --- I am glad to address any concerns that you have!

## Learning Activities

This class uses the Python programming language to equip you with the
mathematical thinking skills that you will need as a software engineer. Through
the implementation and testing of Python programs, you will learn how to
characterize and manipulate a wide variety of mathematical objects, such as
numbers, sets, tuples, and functions. You will complete a wide variety of
learning activities that will help you to be proficient at:

- Remembering and understanding facts about discrete structures

- Applying and analyzing new problems in discrete structures

- Evaluating new solutions to challenges in discrete structures

Some specific activities that you will complete include the following:

- Reading one of the course text books to prepare for in-class activities

- Review course slides in advance of hands-on in-class activities

- Watch course videos on YouTube that the instructor creates to guide
  you through an activity where you apply, analyze, and evaluate new ideas

- Participate in online live coding sessions where you collaborate in real-time
  with the course instructor to implement a solution to a programming challenge

- Complete short and focused practical assignments that help you to master
  specific programming skills in the field of discrete structures

## Project Assessment

You will complete all of your course work through an industry-standard system
called GitHub. All students will create a free GitHub account at the start of
the Fall 2020 semester and use it to receive starter materials and submit the
final version of each laboratory and practical assignment and examination.

Taking inspiration from the principles of specification-based grading, the grade
that a student receives on this assignment will have the following components:

    - Percentage of Correct GatorGrader Checks: Students are encouraged to
      repeatedly try to implement a Java program that passes all of
      GatorGrader's checks by, for instance, creating a program that produces
      the correct output. Students should also repeatedly revise their technical
      writing to ensure that it also passes all of GatorGrader's checks about,
      for instance, the length of its content and its appropriate use of
      Markdown.

    - GitHub CI Build Status: Since additional checks on the source code and/or
      technical writing may be encoded in Travis CI's actions and, moreover, all
      of the GatorGrader checks are also run in Travis CI, students will receive
      a checkmark grade if their last before-the-deadline build passes and a
      green heavy_check_mark appears in their GitHub commit log instead of a red
      âœ—. As with the previous grading component, students are encouraged to
      repeatedly revise their source code and technical writing in an attempt to
      get their Travis CI build to pass.

    - Mastery of Technical Writing: Students will also receive a checkmark grade
      when the responses to the technical writing questions presented in the
      writing/reflection.md reveal a mastery of both writing skills and
      technical knowledge. To receive a checkmark grade, the submitted writing
      should have correct spelling, grammar, and punctuation in addition to
      following the rules of Markdown and providing technically accurate
      answers. Students are encouraged to ask the course instructor or a student
      technical leader to use the GitHub issue tracker to provide feedback on
      their mastery of technical writing skills.

    - Mastery of Technical Knowledge and Skills: Students will receive also
      receive a checkmark grade when their GitHub repository reveals that they
      have mastered all the technical knowledge and skills developed during the
      completion of this project. As a part of this grade, the instructor will
      assess aspects of the project including, but not limited to, the inclusion
      of effective source code comments, creation of Git commit messages,
      correct use of Docker, and correct installation and use of a full-fledge
      Python development environment. Students are encouraged to ask the course
      instructor or a student technical leader to use the GitHub issue tracker
      to provide feedback on how well their work demonstrates mastery of the
      assignment's technical knowledge and skills.

All grades for course projects will be reported through a student's GitHub
repository using either messages in the GitHub commit log or issues raised in
the issue tracker. Students should ask questions about their grade for this
project in GitHub so as to facilitate an effective conversation about the
submitted deliverables.
