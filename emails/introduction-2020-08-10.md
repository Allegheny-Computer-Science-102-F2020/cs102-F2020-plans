Hello CMPSC 102 Students,

## Introduction

At the outset, you should know that I am writing this email to all of the
students who are either registered for the course or who are on the waiting list
for the course. Please understand that it is very likely that I will be able to
add all (or at least the majority) of the students on the waiting list to the
official course roster on the first day of classes, August 31, 2020.

Since I want you to stay up-to-date with the planning for our course, I
encourage you to visit the following GitHub repository for more details:

https://github.com/Allegheny-Computer-Science-102-F2020/cs102-F2020-plans

Even if you do not yet have a GitHub account, you will be able to follow along
in your web browser to see the planning that I am doing for the CMPSC 102
course.

Since I also want you to be able to easily communicate with me and the other
students who will be in the course, I have also setup a Slack workspace. You can
sign-up to join the Slack workspace for free at this web site:

https://join.slack.com/t/cmpsc102fall2020/signup

If you are not sure how to visit the planning site on GitHub or to signup to our
Slack workspace, you can reply to this email with your questions. If you get
stuck on a certain step, don't worry, I will be glad to help!

## Read This Email Carefully

This email is long and includes many details about the CMPSC 102 course. Please
take your time to read, and re-read, this email so that you are comfortable
about how the instructor designed the course, what type of work you will
complete, and the ways in which the instructor will assess you work. To ensure
that we use our in-person course time effectively, the course instructor will
assume that you have carefully read this and other emails before the start of
the Fall 2020 semester.

## Remote Learning

Before I start to explain the details of this course and the way in which I will
teach it, I want to be upfront about the fact that some learning activities that
you will participate in this semester will involve remote interactions. With
that said, I'm confident that you will receive a top-notch introduction to
Discrete Structures through these remote learning opportunities! I also want to
stress that learning how to work in a remote fashion will make you more
competitive for securing a position at a technology company. If you have any
questions about remote learning, I hope that you will ask them in a public
channel in Slack --- I am glad to address any concerns that you have!

## Course Textbooks

There are two course textbooks:

- Programming and Mathematical Thinking: A Gentle Introduction to Discrete Math
  Featuring Python by Allan M. Stavely, Available at: https://is.gd/l5zfpQ

- Doing Math with Python: Use Programming to Explore Algebra, Statistics,
  Calculus, and More! by Amit Saha, Available at: https://is.gd/IQx79D

## Course Teams

To ensure that students can participate in an in-person class in a safe and
socially distanced fashion, the instructor will divide the course into two teams
that will meet on a schedule announced at the start of the Fall 2020 semester.
Within those two large teams, students will be assigned to smaller groups of
individuals in which they can collaborate during the completion of designated
class activities, like the completion of an assignment or the creation of a
response to the weekly technical question. The instructor will provide more
details about your course team assignments after the Fall 2020 semester starts.

## Learning Activities

This class uses the Python programming language to equip you with the
mathematical thinking skills that you will need as a software engineer. Through
the implementation and testing of Python programs, you will learn how to
characterize and manipulate a wide variety of mathematical objects, such as
numbers, sets, tuples, and functions. You will complete a wide variety of
learning activities that will help you to be proficient at:

- Remembering and understanding facts about discrete structures

- Applying and analyzing new problems in discrete structures

- Evaluating new solutions to challenges in discrete structures

Some specific activities that you will complete include the following:

- Read one of the course text books to prepare for in-class activities.

- Review course slides in advance of hands-on in-class activities.

- Watch course videos on YouTube that the instructor creates to guide
  you through an activity where you apply, analyze, and evaluate new approaches
  to solving problems with discrete structures.

- Participate in online live coding sessions where you use video, audio, and
  text to collaborate in real-time with the course instructor to implement a
  solution to a Python programming challenge.

- Participate in remote and socially distanced pair programming sessions with
  (i) other students in the course, (ii) the student technical leaders, and
  (iii) the course instructor as you refine your technical knowledge and skills
  in the context of a programming task or laboratory or practical assignment.

- Ask and answer technical questions about discrete structures in the course's
  Slack workspace and during in-class problem solving and discussion sessions.

- Complete short and focused practical assignments that help you to master
  specific Python programming skills in the field of discrete structures.

- Complete extended laboratory assignments that help you to engineer and
  evaluate full-featured solutions to real-world programming challenges using
  newly developed knowledge about discrete mathematical structures.

## Project Assessment

You will complete all of your course work through an industry-standard system
called GitHub. All students will create a free GitHub account at the start of
the Fall 2020 semester and use it to receive starter materials and submit the
final version of each laboratory and practical assignment and examination.

Taking inspiration from the principles of specification-based grading, the grade
that a student receives on the laboratory assignments will have the following
components:

  - Percentage of Correct GatorGrader Checks: Students are encouraged to
    repeatedly try to implement a Python program that passes all of
    GatorGrader's checks by, for instance, creating a program that produces the
    correct output. Students should also repeatedly revise their technical
    writing to ensure that it also passes all of GatorGrader's checks about, for
    instance, the length of its content and its appropriate use of Markdown. The
    status of each check run by GatorGrader will be available to a student on
    their own laptop and in a GitHub dashboard available in a web browser.

  - GitHub CI Build Status: Since additional checks on the source code and/or
    technical writing may be encoded in GitHub CI's actions and, moreover, all
    of the GatorGrader checks are also run in GitHub CI, students will receive
    a checkmark grade if their last before-the-deadline build passes and a
    green checkmark in their GitHub commit log instead of a red x. As with the
    previous grading component, students are encouraged to repeatedly revise
    their source code and technical writing in an attempt to get their GitHub
    CI build to pass, thereby enabling them to earn the checkmark for this
    component of their grade.

  - Mastery of Technical Writing: Students will also receive a checkmark grade
    when the responses to the technical writing questions presented in the
    writing/reflection.md reveal a mastery of both writing skills and
    technical knowledge. To receive a checkmark grade, the submitted writing
    should have correct spelling, grammar, and punctuation in addition to
    following the rules of Markdown and providing technically accurate
    answers. Students are encouraged to ask the course instructor or a student
    technical leader to use the GitHub issue tracker to provide feedback on
    their mastery of technical writing skills.

  - Mastery of Technical Knowledge and Skills: Students will also receive a
    checkmark grade when their GitHub repository reveals that they have
    mastered all the technical knowledge and skills developed during the
    completion of this project. As a part of this grade, the instructor will
    assess aspects of the project including, but not limited to, the inclusion
    of effective source code comments, creation of Git commit messages,
    correct use of Docker, implementation of an efficient Python program, and
    correct installation and use of a full-fledge Python development
    environment. Students are encouraged to ask the course instructor or a
    student technical leader to use the GitHub issue tracker to provide
    feedback on how well their work demonstrates mastery of the assignment's
    technical knowledge and skills.

The sole grade for a practical assignment will be the GitHub CI Build Status,
meaning that you will receive either a checkmark or an x for the completion of
the assignment, as described in the above paragraph.

All grades for course projects will be reported through a student's GitHub
repository using either messages in the GitHub commit log or issues raised in
the issue tracker. Students should ask questions about their grade for any
project in GitHub so as to facilitate an effective conversation about the
submitted deliverables and to ensure that a student can ultimately master all of
the technical knowledge and skills developed as part of that assignment.

## Project Feedback

Students who wish to receive feedback on their work for either a practical or a
laboratory assignment should first open an issue in the issue tracker of a
project's GitHub repository, giving an appropriate title and description for the
type of feedback that you would like the course instructor to provide. After
creating this issue, a student will see that GitHub has created a unique web
site that references this issue. To alert the course instructor to the fact that
the issue was created and that you want feedback on your work, please send it to
him by a Slack direct message at least 24 hours in advance of the project's due
date. After the instructor responds to the issue, please resolve all of the
stated concerns and participate in the discussion until the issue is closed.

## Learning Assessments

Students will have numerous opportunities to demonstrate that they have mastered
the technical knowledge and skills in the field of discrete structures. In
addition to giving students feedback on all of their in-class, laboratory, and
practical assignments, the course instructor will invite students to complete
the following course assessments, thereby better helping them to assess their
mastery of course content.

- Short, weekly mastery quizzes that are administered through a web browser and
  for which a student will automatically receive a grade upon quiz completion.

- Two interim examinations that the course instructor will respectively
  administer after about the fifth week and tenth weeks of the semester.
  Students will use GitHub and a text editor to complete both of these
  examinations under the Allegheny College Honor Code.

- A final examination that the course instructor will administer on the day set
  for the final examination. Students will use GitHub and a text editor to
  complete the final examination under the Allegheny College Honor Code.

Both the interim examinations and the final examination will be conducted in an
online fashion in an un-proctored fashion. Students will have a set period of
time to complete the examinations and will be expected to complete them in
accordance with standards that uphold the Allegheny College Honor Code.

## Weekly Technical Questions

Each week of the course will have a guiding technical question designed to focus
all of the in-class activities and to ensure that students are developing a
thorough understanding of the key topics in the field of discrete structures.
Students should use their textbooks and the course slides, videos, and live
coding sessions to developer and submit a comprehensive response for each week's
technical question.At the end of the week, students will use GitHub and a text
editor to submit an answer to the question, for which they will receive an
checkmark-based assessment and feedback from the instructor.

## Technologies for Learning About Discrete Structures
