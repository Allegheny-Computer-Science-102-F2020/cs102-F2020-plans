Hello CMPSC 102 Students,

As you will recall, about one week ago I sent you an email that introduced the CMPSC
102 course. Today I wanted to remind you of several important points about the
CMPSC 102 course and then ask you to complete a survey about your use of a
laptop for the course, only if you have not already done so.

Here are the three key points I want you to remember:

-- 1) Since I want you to stay up-to-date with the planning for our course, I
encourage you to visit the following GitHub repository for more details:

https://github.com/Allegheny-Computer-Science-102-F2020/cs102-F2020-plans

If you have not already checked the GitHub repository, then please do so! I will
also be updating the content in this repository throughout the next two weeks
and then during the entirety of the Fall 2020 academic semester.

-- 2) Since I also want you to be able to easily communicate with me and the other
students who will be in the course, I have setup a Slack workspace. You can
sign-up to join the Slack workspace for free at this web site:

https://join.slack.com/t/cmpsc102fall2020/signup

If you have not already joined our Slack workspace, then please do so at your
earliest convenience. Instead of using email for communication during the Fall
2020 academic semester I will primarily communicate with students through Slack.
In addition to informally chatting with the other people in the course, you can
of course also start asking me questions through Slack at any time!

-- 3) All students must have a department approved laptop to take the CMPSC 102
course. You can learn whether or not your laptop meets the guidelines for being
a department approved laptop by visiting this web site:
