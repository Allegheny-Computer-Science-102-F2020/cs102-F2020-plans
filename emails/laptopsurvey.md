Hello CMPSC 102 Students,

## Read This Email Carefully

This email is very long and includes many details about the CMPSC 102 course.
Instead of bombarding you with many short emails, I will continue to write you a
smaller number of more detailed emails and then archive them in our course's
GitHub repository. Please take your time to read and regularly review this email
so that you are comfortable with how the instructor designed the course, what
type of work you will complete, and the ways in which the instructor will assess
your work. To ensure that we effectively use our in-person course time, the
course instructor will assume that you have carefully read this, and any other
necessary follow-on emails, before the start of the Fall 2020 semester.

## Introduction

As you will recall, awhile ago I sent you an email that introduced the CMPSC 102
course. Today I wanted to remind you of several important points about the CMPSC
102 course and then ask you to complete a survey about your use of a laptop for
the course --- but only if you have not already done so. Finally, I am going to
share some updates about the first week of the Fall 2020 semester and then
furnish a high-level overview of our course's structure.

## Laptop Survey

Specifically, if you have not already done so, please complete the following
survey about the use of a laptop for the Fall 2020 semester:

https://forms.gle/wHt8F7d9o7ANh8DG6

While I recognize that many of you will have already received an invitation from
the Chair of the Department of Computer Science to complete this form, it is
possible that some students, especially if they are in their first semester at
Allegheny College or if they are on the waiting list for this course, have not
already completed this survey.

Importantly, it is mandatory for you to complete this survey before the start of
the Fall 2020 semester. If you do not have a laptop that meets the guidelines
set by the Department of Computer Science then I urge you to complete this
survey at your earliest convenience. As I mentioned in my last email to you and
I point out again in the remainder of this note, every student who enrolls in
CMPSC 102 for the Fall 2020 semester must have a laptop that is approved for use
in the Department of Computer Science.

## First Week of Class

Since there are many students who are interested in taking this class and yet
are still on the course waiting list due to the College's registration
procedure, I don't yet know how many students must fit into our classroom at the
same time. Moreover, until I add everyone to the class, I will not be able to
fairly divide us into groups that will meet in person according to a set
schedule, thereby ensuring that we never exceed the room limit for our
classroom and that you are safer during the Fall 2020 semester.

Therefore, to ensure that you are all safe during the first week of classes, I
will be holding all classes, which are scheduled for M/W/F 10:20 AM - 11:10 AM
through a Google Meet link that I will provide on Monday morning of next week.

Before you click this link, please make sure that you take the following steps:

-- Ensure that you have headphones connected to your laptop and that you are
able to hear sound through your headphones when you use Google Meet. Please note
that you can test to ensure that your sound is working by visiting the following
site and creating a sample Google Meet of which you are the only member:

https://meet.google.com/

-- Ensure that your video is working correctly on your laptop so that it records
you face and can transmit it correctly to Google Meet. Again, you can test this
by using the aforementioned web site. If you click the three vertical dots in
the right-hand-side of Google Meet then you can go into the settings and confirm
that your audio and video are working correctly. Please note that you must
complete these steps before the start of our first class next week.

-- If you laptop and Internet connection will support it, please configure
Google Meet to transmit and receive video at the 720p resolution. Picking these
settings will ensure that you can read all of the video content that I stream to
you and that everyone else in the class can clearly see your face. If you find
that your connection drops regularly or the video becomes choppy or irregular
then you can pick a lower level of video quality and see if that helps.

After clicking this link, please make sure that you take the following steps:

-- You should mute your microphone if you are not talking so that noise from
your laptop is not transmitted into the meeting.

-- You should "pin" my video stream to your center screen by clicking a pin icon
that will appear when you hover your mouse near the center of my video.

-- If you want to ask a question or participate in a discussion, then you need
to type a `*` into the chat window of Google Meet. I will use this symbol as an
indicator that the student who typed it wants to contribute to our conversation
by making a point or asking a question.

-- Unless your laptop or Internet connection does not support it, please leave
your video enabled during all of the classroom sessions. Since these Google
Meets are private for our class, there is not, to my knowledge, a risk that
outsiders will enter our class or be able to record your video. By keeping your
video enabled it will enable me and the other students in the class to see who
is talking and who is currently engaged in the course.

During the first three classes, please keep in mind the following points:

-- I will be recording from my home studio which means that you will not be able
to find me in my office in Alden Hall to ask me questions about your laptop or
the Google Meet software.

-- During the class sessions next week, you will see that I will switch between
full screen video and the projection of various programs on my laptop. If I am
not using full screen video, then you will see my face in a small circle
normally on the right-hand side of your video.

-- Throughout the semester I will use specialized broadcasting software that
will allow me to seamlessly change between different scenes and sources during
our classroom and laboratory and practical sessions. If something goes wrong
with the broadcasting software, then please use a `*` in the Google Meet chat.
Once you receive my acknowledgment you can explain what problem you are
experiencing so that I can resolve it quickly and move on with the class.

## Remainder of the Fall 2020 Semester

I will share more details about the remainder of the Fall 2020 semester during
our first week of the semester and through our GitHub planning repository to
which I provided you a link in a previous email and in this email.

Due to the large size of our course and due to the limited space in Alden Hall,
you will normally have one in-person class with me per week. When you are not in
class you will be completing activities that are guided by specialized YouTube
videos and live streaming sessions through either YouTube Live or Google Meet.

We will have all of our course's laboratory and practical sessions through
either YouTube Live or Google Meet. The student technical leaders and I will be
available to answer your questions about an assignment through YouTube, Google
Meet, and/or Slack. You will also actively participate in these sessions by, for
instance, live coding with me and the other student technical leaders, asking
questions and interactively working through each of the steps in the assignment.

During the laboratory and practical sessions you will be able to pair program
with me and the other student technical leaders through programs like VS Code. I
will also release a survey every week in which you can request that I make a
customized YouTube video about any topic that I covered during the recently
completed week. Through my web site and our course's GitHub repositories, every
week you will have access to all the assignment sheets, reading assignments,
course slides, Python source code, and any accompanying data or other materials.

## Encouragement for the Fall 2020 Semester

Although I recognize that I will be teaching CMPSC 102 differently than all of
the other courses that I have taught at Allegheny College, I want you to know
that I have been carefully planning the course for the entire summer! In fact,
I've been using the majority of the remote-learning technologies that we will
use this semester for many years. I find remote collaboration and learning a lot
of fun and I anticipate that you will also find it fun and effective!

I must move several of the CMPSC 102 course activities to an online venue so as
to ensure that I keep you as safe as is possible and that we all comply with the
state and College guidelines concerning, for instance, the occupancy level of
our classroom space and the number of feet between each person who is inside of
the classroom. While this may not be ideal, it is an absolute necessity.

Although the course will be different, I'm really excited about this new format
and I look forward to convincing you of its merits throughout the semester.
Importantly, you will be learning to use all of the remote working technology
that is normally adopted by experts in industry, thereby better ensuring that
you are prepared for a position in the software and technology fields.

Finally, I want to encourage you to actively engage with the course throughout
the Fall 2020 semester. It is important that you watch all of the videos,
participate in the YouTube Live streams and Google Meets, use all of the
required software, and attend all of the in-person classroom sessions. To ensure
that you best succeed in this course you must take ownership of your education
by completing all of the work on time and communicating effectively with me and
the student technical leaders who are a part of the course's support team.

## Reminders

Here are some key points I want you to remember from my previous email:

-- 1) To date, I anticipate that I can add everyone to the course who is on the
waiting list. If you completed the waiting list form, then you should be able to
add the course at the starting of the Fall 2020 semester. To add the course, you
will need to express to me in writing during the first or second class that you
want to join the course. I will then use "Add Authorization" feature of Self
Service during the first few classes and you should then see that CMPSC 102 Fall
2020 is visible in your course roster.

Please note that, by default, I will not automatically add the name of each
student on the waiting list to the course roster. This is because not everyone
on the waiting list may still want to take CMPSC 102. As such, during the first
two class periods I will need you to write to me by email to express your
confirmed interest in taking the CMPSC 102 Fall 2020 course. Please refer to the
previous content about the first week of classes for more details on this issue.

-- 2) Since I want you to stay up-to-date with the planning for our course, I
encourage you to visit the following GitHub repository for more details:

https://github.com/Allegheny-Computer-Science-102-F2020/cs102-F2020-plans

If you have not already checked the GitHub repository, then please do so! I will
also be updating the content in this repository throughout this week and then
during the entirety of the Fall 2020 academic semester.

-- 3) Since I also want you to be able to easily communicate with me and the
other students who will be in the course, I have setup a Slack workspace. You
can sign-up to join the Slack workspace for free at this web site:

https://join.slack.com/t/cmpsc102fall2020/signup

If you have not already joined our Slack workspace, then please do so at your
earliest convenience. Instead of using email for communication during the Fall
2020 academic semester I will primarily communicate with students through Slack.
In addition to informally chatting with the other people in the course, you can
also start asking me questions through Slack at any time!

-- 4) All students must have a department approved laptop to take the CMPSC 102
course. You can learn whether or not your laptop meets the guidelines for being
a department approved laptop by visiting this web site:

https://www.cs.allegheny.edu/resources/laptops/

Please note that, along with bringing a laptop, you must have headphones that
will allow you to participate in online sessions while hearing all content
through your headphones. As your schedule permits during the remainder of the
summer, I encourage you to please explore the various programs I mentioned in my
previous email so that you are able to participate in all course activities.

Here is a summary of the technologies that we will use during the semester.
Please make sure that, during the first week of the semester, you have taken the
required steps to install these programs on your laptop. If you are not able to
install these programs on your laptop, then I will be available through Google
Meet during office hours, virtual classroom sessions, and the laboratory and
practical sessions to ensure that your system is correctly up and running!

- You will use Docker Desktop to run programs that the course instructor
  provides to you through a Docker container. To learn more about Docker, you
  can visit the following web site:

  https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop

  To learn if your laptop can run Docker Desktop, please visit this web site:

  https://www.cs.allegheny.edu/canirundocker/

  **IMPORTANT**: All students are required to run Docker Desktop on their laptop so
  as to ensure that they can run the instructor-provided Docker containers.

- You will use version 3.8 of the Python programming language that you installed
  on your department approved laptop by using either the Pyenv or Pyenv-win
  tools that are available for download from GitHub. You can learn more about
  Python by visiting this web site:

  https://www.python.org/

  You can learn more about Pyenv and Pyenv-win by visiting these web sites:

  https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv

  https://github.com/pyenv-win/pyenv-win

- You will use the Poetry tool for managing the Python package and dependencies
  that you need to install for each laboratory or practical assignment. You can
  learn more about Poetry and its features by visiting this web site:

  https://python-poetry.org/

- You will use the VS Code text editor when you need to implement and run a
  Python program and write technical documentation in Markdown. Students who
  want to pair program with the course instructor, one of the student technical
  leaders, or another student in the class should also use VS Code's Live Share
  feature. Although students may elect to use a different text editor than VS
  Code, the course instructor and the student technical leaders will only be
  available for remote pair programming and debugging through VS Code. You can
  learn more about VS Code by visiting this web site:

  https://code.visualstudio.com/

- You will use a terminal window to allows you to execute commands such as the
  creation of a virtual environment or the execution of a Python program.
  Students may consider using a customized terminal for their operating system
  or the integrated terminal in VS Code. Students should work with the course
  instructor and the student technical leaders to ensure that their chosen
  terminal window will support all of the course activities, such as running a
  Python program, starting a Docker container, and running an assessment tool
  like GatorGrader.
