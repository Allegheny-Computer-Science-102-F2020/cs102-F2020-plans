# Learning Objectives for Mathematically Informed Communication

- **Discrete Structures**:
  - Given the opportunity to input, store, and output a new type of data, the
    learner will pick the correct discrete structure (e.g., a number, set,
    sequence, dictionary, or tree) and then:
    - Implement it and integrate it into a correct, well-tested, and
      well-documented Python program of consisting of between one hundred and
      five hundred lines of code.
    - Use formal and precise mathematical language to correctly describe the
      representation, behavior, and limitations of the new type of data.
  - Given the formal definition of a discrete structure, the learner will
    correctly translate it into a Python program, bearing in mind the ways in
    which the working system may diverge from the formal definition due to, for
    instance, implementation concerns related to computational costs and storage
    overheads.
  - Given the formal definition of a discrete structure and its implementation
    as a Python program, the learner will correctly describe its properties,
    demonstrate and verify those properties through testing, and explain how it
    is similar to and different from other discrete structures.

- **Mathematical Functions**:
  - Leveraging their understanding of higher-order functions, lambda functions,
    and generating functions, the learner will, given a problem statement
    involving discrete structures, be able to:
    - Translate the formal notation and equations used in the problem statement
      to an algorithm that describes, in a step-by-step fashion, how to solve
      the problem.
    - Pick the most suitable type of function(s) for the problem, implement it in
      an industry-standard fashion, and then use testing to demonstrate its
      correctness and experimentation to evaluate its performance.
    - Use formal statements to defend the validity of their design,
      implementation, and testing decisions made when solving the problem with
      the chosen function(s).

- **Data Analysis**:
  - Given a data set of textual and numerical values, the learner will implement
    and use:
    - An appropriate statistical technique as a Python function to summarize and
      analyze the data.
    - An appropriate visualization technique as a Python function that can
      create graphs and diagrams that highlight the salient properties of the
      data set.
