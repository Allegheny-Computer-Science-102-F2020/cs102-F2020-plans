# Learning Objectives for Mathematically Informed Communication

- **Discrete Structures**:
  - Given the opportunity to input, store, and output a new type of data, the
    learner will pick the correct discrete structure (e.g., a number, set,
    multi-set, or sequence) and then:
    - Implement it and integrate it into a correct, well-tested, and
      well-documented Python program of between one hundred and five hundred
      lines of code.
    - Use formal and precise mathematical language to correctly describe the
      representation, behavior, and limitations of the new data type.
  - Given the formal definition of a discrete structure, the learner will
    correctly translate it into a Python function, bearing in mind the ways in
    which the working Python function may diverge from the formal definition due
    to implementation concerns related to computational costs and storage
    overheads.
  - Given the formal definition of a discrete structure and its implementation
    as a Python function, the learner will correctly describe its properties,
    demonstrate and verify those properties through testing, and explain how the
    it is similar to and different from other discrete
    structures.

- **Data Analysis**:
  - Given a data set of textual and numerical values, the learner will implement
    and use:
    - An appropriate statistical technique as a Python function to summarize and
      analyze the data.
    - An appropriate visualization technique as a Python function that can
      create graphs and diagrams that highlight the salient properties of the
      data set.

- **Mathematical Functions**:
  - Leveraging their understanding of higher-order functions, lambda functions,
    and generating functions, the learner will, given a problem statement
    involving discrete structures, pick the most suitable type of function for the
    problem, implement it in an industry-standard fashion, and then use testing to
    demonstrate its correctness and experimentation to evaluate its performance.
