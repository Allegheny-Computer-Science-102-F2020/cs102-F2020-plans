# Learning Objectives for Mathematical Thinking

- Given the opportunity to input, store, and output a new type of data, the
  learner will pick the correct mathematical object (e.g., a number, set,
  multi-set, or sequence) and then implement it and integrate it into a correct,
  well-tested, and well-documented Python program of between one hundred and
  five hundred lines.

- Given the opportunity to input, store, and output a new type of data, the
  learner will pick the correct mathematical object (e.g., a number, set,
  multi-set, or sequence) and use formal and precise mathematical language to
  correctly describe the representation, behavior, and limitations of the new
  data type.

- Given a data set of textual and numerical values, the learner will implement
  an appropriate statistical technique as a Python function to summarize and
  analyze the data.

- Given a data set of textual and numerical values, the learner will implement
  an appropriate visualization technique as a Python function and then use the
  function to create graphs and diagrams that highlight the salient properties
  of the data set.

- Given the formal definition of a discrete structure, the learner will
  correctly translate it into a Python function, bearing in mind the ways in
  which the working Python function may diverge from the formal definition due
  to implementation concerns related to computational and storage overhead.

- Given the formal definition of a discrete structure and its implementation
  as a Python function, the learner will correctly describe its properties and
  explain how it is similar to and different from other discrete structures.

- Leveraging and understanding of higher-order functions, lambda functions, and
  generating functions, the learner will, given a problem statement involving
  discrete structures, pick the most suitable type of function for the problem,
  implement it, and then use testing to demonstrate its correctness and
  experimentation to evaluate its performance.
