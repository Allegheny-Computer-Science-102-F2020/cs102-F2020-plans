# Learning Objectives for Mathematical Thinking

- Given the opportunity to input, store, and output a new type of data, the
  learner will pick the correct mathematical object (e.g., a number, set,
  multi-set, or sequence) and then implement it and integrate it into a correct,
  well-tested, and well-documented Python program of between one hundred and
  five hundred lines.

- Given a data set of textual and numerical values, the learner will implement
  an appropriate statistical technique as a Python function to summarize and
  analyze the data.

- Given a data set of textual and numerical values, the learner will implement
  an appropriate visualization technique as a Python function and then use the
  function to create graphs and diagrams that highlight the salient properties
  of the data set.

- Given the formal definition of a discrete structure, the learner will
  correctly translate it into a Python function, bearing in mind the ways in
  which the working function may diverge from the formal definition due to
  implementation concerns related to computational and storage overhead.
