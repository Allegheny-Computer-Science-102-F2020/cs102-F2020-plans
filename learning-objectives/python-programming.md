# Learning Objectives for Python Programming

- **Performing Python Programming**:
  - A learner will write short Python functions of ten to twenty lines that have
    the following characteristics:
    - Has function and variable names that adhere to an industry-standard coding
      style.
    - Has descriptive comments for both the function declaration and the
      function's code that adhere to an industry-standard coding style.
    - Features a source code format that adheres to an industry-standard coding
      style.
    - Has a high-coverage test suite, written with an industry-standard
      framework, that effectively exercises at least the 70% of the statements
      and branches in the function.
    - Passes the test suite and furnishes a correct implementation of the
      specification for the function.
    - Performs the specified operation in an efficient fashion, as determined
      through experiments that evaluate the function's performance.
    - Correctly uses assignment statements, iteration constructs, conditional
      logic, and recursion in a way that passes the test suite, works
      efficiently, and conveys the intended purpose of the function.
    - Correctly uses discrete structures such as numbers, tuples, sets, streams,
      and sequences in a way that passes the test suite, works efficiently, and
      conveys the intended purpose of the function.

- **Using Python Programming Tools**:
  - A learner will use a Python programming environment to complete these tasks
    while implementing a Python program consisting of between one and five
      hundred lines of code:
    - Install, upgrade, and use the Python 3.8 interpreter to run a Python
      program.
    - Create a virtual environment with Poetry and use it to run a Python
      program without error in an isolated and self-contained setting.
    - Use Docker to run without error a program a Python program in an isolated
      container that can run the test suite and autograding tools.
    - Use testing to detect a failure in a Python program and then effectively
      use tools like a text editor and a terminal window to find and fix the
      failure, ultimately confirming that the Python programs not longer
      contains the failure and the fix did not compromise other functions in the
      program.

- **Using Version Control Systems**:
  - A learner will use the GitHub version control system in the following
    fashion:
    - Clone a GitHub repository without error using either a terminal window or
      a Git integration in a text editor like VS Code.
    - Write short and descriptive commit messages that explain the specific way
      in which the commit changes the source code and documentation in the
      GitHub repository.
    - Use GitHub pre-commit hooks to ensure that all of the source code,
      technical writing, and commit messages adhere to the industry standards
      for content and format.
    - Create and discuss programming and technical writing issues through the
      use of the GitHub issue tracker, furnishing descriptive issue titles and
      descriptions that adhere to industry best practices.
    - Submit completed projects that pass all of the instructor-provided and
      industry-standard checks, as evidenced through the report of a passing
      build by GitHub Actions.
