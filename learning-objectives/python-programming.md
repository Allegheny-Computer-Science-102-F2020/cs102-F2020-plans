# Learning Objectives for Python Programming

- A learner will write short Python functions of ten to twenty lines that have
  the following characteristics:
  - Has function and variable names that adhere to an industry-standard coding
    style.
  - Has descriptive comments for both the function declaration and the
    function's code that adhere to an industry-standard coding style.
  - Has a format that adheres to an industry-standard coding style.
  - Has a high-coverage test suite, written with an industry-standard framework,
    that effectively exercises the statements and branches in the function.
  - Passes the test suite and furnishes a correct implementation of the
    specification for the function.
  - Performs the specified operation in an efficient fashion, as determined
    through experiments that evaluate the function's performance.
  - Correctly uses discrete structures such as numbers, tuples, sets, streams,
    and sequences in a way that passes the test suite, works efficiently, and
    conveys the intended purpose of the function.

- A learner will use the GitHub version control system in the following fashion:
  - Clone a GitHub repository without error using either a terminal window or a
    Git integration in a text editor like VS Code.
  - Write short and descriptive commit messages that describe the specific way
    in which a commit changes the source code and documentation in the
    repository.
  - Create and discuss programming and technical writing issues through the use
    of the GitHub issue tracker, creating descriptive issue titles and
    descriptions that adhere to industry best practices.
