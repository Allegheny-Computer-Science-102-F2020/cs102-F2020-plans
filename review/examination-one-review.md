## Examination Overview

The exam will be closed notes and closed book and it will cover the following
materials. Please review the course schedule to see the content and slides
that we have covered to this date. Students may post questions about this
material to our Slack team.

The exam will be a mix of questions that have a form such as short answer,
completion, the interpretation and creation of Python source code, and the
interpretation of Python program output. The emphasis will be on the following
technical topics:
