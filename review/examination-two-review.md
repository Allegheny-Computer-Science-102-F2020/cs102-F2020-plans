### Examination Overview

The exam will be closed notes and closed book and it will cover the following
materials. Please review the course schedule to see the content and slides that
we have covered to this date. Students may post questions about this material to
our Slack team.

The exam will be a mix of questions that have a form such as short answer,
completion, the interpretation and creation of Python source code, and the
interpretation of Python program output. The final examination is comprehensive,
meaning that it covers all of the content that we studied in this course in the
class sessions and laboratory, practical, and technical challenge assignments.
The emphasis will be on the following technical topics:

### Honor Code for the Final Examination

- You must adhere to the Honor Code throughout your completion of the examination
- The examination is closed notes, closed book, and closed online resources

**IMPORTANT**: All students in this course are obligated to adhere to the
Allegheny College Honor Code throughout the completion of this examination. If
the instructor detects that a student has committed a likely violation of the
Allegheny College Honor Code, then he will file a report with the Dean of
Students Office. Please make sure that you review the [Honor
Code](https://sites.allegheny.edu/about/honor-code/) before you start to take
this examination. Please note that, due to the ongoing global pandemic, Sections
1 and 2 of Honor Code Article IV are not enforced for this examination.
