## Technical Questions

### Week One: August 31, 2020 to September 4, 2020

- How do I install and use the industry-standard [Programming
  Tools](../tools/programming-tools.md) that will help me to rigorously
  explore discrete structures with the Python programming language?

**Reading Assignments**

- Details about all of the referenced [programming tools](../tools/programming-tools.md)

### Week Two: September 7, 2020 to September 11, 2020

- How do I connect mathematical terminology (e.g., *mapping*, *function*,
  *number*, and *set*), to the implementation of Python programs that declare
  and call functions and declare and manipulate variables?

**Reading Assignments**

- Chapters 1 and 2 of *Programming and Mathematical Thinking*
- Chapter 1 of *Doing Math with Python*

### Week Two: September 14, 2020 to September 18, 2020

- How do I use iteration and conditional logic in a Python program to perform
  computational tasks like processing the contents of a file and mathematical
  tasks like using Newton's method to approximate the square root of a number?

**Reading Assignments**

- Chapter 3 of *Programming and Mathematical Thinking*
- Appendix B of *Doing Math with Python*
