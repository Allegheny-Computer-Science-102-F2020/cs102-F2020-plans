# Bloom's Taxonomy

## Introduction

Please note that, to ensure conformity with the standard definitions in the
education field, the description of these levels is directly quoted from
[Teaching Tech Together](https://teachtogether.tech/), which is available for
free download in English and Spanish.

## Overview

Remembering:

  Exhibit memory of previously learned material by recalling facts, terms,
  basic concepts, and answers. (recognize, list, describe, name, find)

Understanding:

  Demonstrate understanding of facts and ideas by organizing, comparing,
  translating, interpreting, giving descriptions, and stating main ideas.
  (interpret, summarize, paraphrase, classify, explain)

Applying:

  Solve new problems by applying acquired knowledge, facts, techniques and
  rules in a different way. (build, identify, use, plan, select)

Analyzing:

    Examine and break information into parts by identifying motives or causes;
    make inferences and find evidence to support generalizations. (compare,
    contrast, simplify)

Evaluating:

    Present and defend opinions by making judgments about information, validity
    of ideas, or quality of work based on a set of criteria. (check, choose,
    critique, prove, rate)

Creating:

    Compile information together in a different way by combining elements in a
    new pattern or proposing alternative solutions. (design, construct, improve,
    adapt, maximize, solve)

- The [technical challenges](../assignments/technical-challenge.md) invite
  learners to complete tasks primarily at the **remembering** and
  **understanding** levels of Bloom's taxonomy.

- The [practical assignments](../assignments/practical-assignment.md) invite
  learners to complete tasks primarily at the **understanding** and **applying**
  levels of Bloom's taxonomy.

- The [laboratory assignments](../assignments/laboratory-assignment.md) invite
  learners to complete tasks primarily at the **applying**, **analyzing**, and
  **evaluating** levels of Bloom's taxonomy.
