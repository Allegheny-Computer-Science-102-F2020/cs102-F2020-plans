## Connections

- The [technical challenges](../assignments/technical-challenge.md) invite
  learners to complete tasks primarily at the **remembering** and
  **understanding** levels of Bloom's taxonomy.

- The [practical assignments](../assignments/practical-assignment.md) invite
  learners to complete tasks primarily at the **understanding** and **applying**
  levels of Bloom's taxonomy.

- The [laboratory assignments](../assignments/laboratory-assignment.md) invite
  learners to complete tasks primarily at the **applying**, **analyzing**, and
  **evaluating** levels of Bloom's taxonomy.
