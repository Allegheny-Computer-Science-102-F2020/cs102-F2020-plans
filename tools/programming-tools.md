## GitHub

Throughout this semester, the course instructor will use GitHub to deliver to
you all of the starting source code and documentation for the technical
challenges, practical assignments, and laboratory assignments. In addition to
using GitHub to submit all of your assignments to the course instructor, you can
use GitHub to engage with the instructor and the student technical leaders to
ask questions about your work. The GitHub repositories that you create for your
assignments will also serve as an archive of the material that you can review
for the quizzes and examinations that you will take. To learn more about GitHub,
you can visit the following web sites:

  - [GitHub](https://github.com/)
  - [GitHub Classroom](https://classroom.github.com/)
  - [GitHub Guides on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/githubguides)
  - [Git Version Control Tool](https://git-scm.com/)
  - [Pro Git Book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2)

## Visual Studio Code

Since the [2019 Stack Overflow Technology
Survey](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2019#technology) reports that
Visual Studio Code (or VSCode) is the most popular development environment, you
will exclusively use it to complete Python programming and technical writing
projects in the field of discrete structures. In addition to providing a wide
variety of program analysis, debugging, linting, and testing tools, VSCode
supports live share programming where two programmers can work together in the
same development environment! VSCode also features an extremely popular and
powerful Python programming extensions that will make your assignments
significantly easier. To learn more about VSCode, you can visit the following
web sites:

  - [VSCode Code Editor](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
  - [VSCode Python Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python)
  - [VSCode Live Share Overview](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/services/live-share/)
  - [VSCode Live Share Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MS-vsliveshare.vsliveshare)
  - [VSCode Live Share Extension Pack](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MS-vsliveshare.vsliveshare-pack)

## Docker

Since a Docker container provides a wide variety of programming tools that
support the implementation and assessment of a Python program, it makes it
easier for you to start programming right away! You are invited to use Docker
Desktop to run programs that the course instructor provides to you through a
Docker container. To learn more about Docker, you can visit the following web
sites:

  - [Can I Run Docker?](https://www.cs.allegheny.edu/canirundocker/)
  - [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
  - [Docker Desktop Overview](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/)
  - [Install Docker Desktop on Mac](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/)
  - [Install Docker Desktop on Mac](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/)

## Python

The Python programming language is simple and powerful! Since there are a wide
variety of development tools and packages that support programming in Python, we
will use this language as our main vehicle for exploring discrete structures.
Since the version of Python delivered by your operating system may be out of
date (or Python may not be readily available on your operating system), you are
invited to install version 3.8 of the Python programming language by using
either the Pyenv or Pyenv-win tools that are available for download from GitHub.
You can learn more about Python by visiting these web sites:

  - [Python](https://www.python.org/)
  - [Pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv)
  - [Pyenv-Win](https://github.com/pyenv-win/pyenv-win)

## Python Packages

The Python programming language features a wide variety of popular and powerful
packages that enable you to more effectively write efficient and correct
programs. Although we will only explore a limited number of Python packages this
semester, we will use the Poetry packaging and dependency management tool
support the installation of the packages that you will use to complete the
course assignments. We will also use the Pytest testing framework to write and
run test cases that help us to know whether or not our Python program is
correct. Finally, we will use the Streamlit system to create web-based
interfaces for our Python applications that explore the field of discrete
structures. Of course, there are many other Python packages that you can explore
through the Python Package Index. You can learn more about these Python packages
by visiting these web sites:

  - [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/)
  - [Pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/)
  - [Streamlit](https://www.streamlit.io/)
  - [Python Package Index](https://pypi.org/)

## Markdown

In addition to implementing and testing programs in Python, you will write
technical documentation using Markdown, a formatting language that enables you
to use rules to control the display of plain text in your GitHub repository. For
instance, Markdown has features that enable it to display source code, itemized
lists, and graphics. Importantly, you can edit Markdown files inside of your
VSCode text editor and store them in your GitHub repository. Students will write
in Markdown as part of the laboratory and practical assignments and the course
examinations. You can learn more about the Markdown language for technical
writing by visiting these web sites:

  - [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/)
  - [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/)
  - [Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
