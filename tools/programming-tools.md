## Docker

Since a Docker container provides a wide variety of programming tools that
support the implementation and assessment of a Python program, it makes it
easier for you to start programming right away! You are invited to use Docker
Desktop to run programs that the course instructor provides to you through a
Docker container. To learn more about Docker, you can visit the following web
sites:

## Python

The Python programming language is simple and powerful! Since there are a wide
variety of development tools and packages that support programming in Python, we
will use this language as our main vehicle for exploring discrete structures.
Since the version of Python delivered by your operating system may be out of
date (or Python may not be readily available on your operating system), you are
invited to install version 3.8 of the Python programming language by using
either the Pyenv or Pyenv-win tools that are available for download from GitHub.
You can learn more about Python by visiting these web sites:

  - [Python](https://www.python.org/)
  - [Pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv)
  - [Pyenv-Win](https://github.com/pyenv-win/pyenv-win)
