## Non-Interactive Docker Commands

Once you have installed [Docker
Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop), with MacOS and Linux
you can use the following `docker run` command to start `gradle grade` as a
containerized application, using the
[DockaGator](https://github.com/GatorEducator/dockagator) Docker image available
on
[DockerHub](https://cloud.docker.com/u/gatoreducator/repository/docker/gatoreducator/dockagator).

```bash
docker run --rm --name dockagator \
  -v "$(pwd)":/project \
  -v "$HOME/.dockagator":/root/.local/share \
  gatoreducator/dockagator
```

The aforementioned command will use `"$(pwd)"` (i.e., the current working
directory) as the project directory and `"$HOME/.dockagator"` as the cached
GatorGrader directory. Please note that both of these directories must exist,
although only the project directory must contain something. Generally, the
project directory should contain the source code and technical writing for an
assignment, as provided to a student by the instructor through GitHub.
Additionally, the cached directory should not contain anything other than
directories and programs created by DockaGator, thus ensuring that they are not
otherwise overwritten during the completion of the assignment.

To ensure that the previous command will work correctly, you should create the
cache directory by running the command `mkdir $HOME/.dockagator` on the MacOS
and Linux operating systems. However, if you are using the Windows operating
system then you will instead need to type the command `mkdir
%HomeDrive%%HomePath%/.dockagator`. Finally, since the above `docker run`
command does not work correctly on the Windows operating system, you will need
to instead run the following command to adapt to the differences in the `cmd`
terminal window:

```bash
docker run --rm --name dockagator \
  -v "%cd%:/project" \
  -v "%HomeDrive%%HomePath%/.dockagator:/root/.local/share" \
  gatoreducator/dockagator
```

Please note that not all version of the Windows terminal window will correctly
recognize the use of the `%cd%` and `%HomeDrive%%HomePath%` variables. In this
case, you should substitute the actual directory for a specific course
assignment for the `%cd%` variable and the drive letter that contains the
`.dockagator` directory for the `%HomeDrive%%HomePath%` variable. Finally, the
Windows terminal window may not work correctly when you attempt to run a
multi-line command. In this case, you should break up the aforementioned
four-line command into separate lines, like `docker run --rm --name dockagator`
and `-v "%cd%:/project"` and then connect them into a single long line that you
separate by a single space. Here is an example of what the long command would
look like, again assuming that the Windows `cmd` terminal correctly interprets
the `%cd%` and `%HomeDrive%%HomePath%` variables:

```bash
docker run -it --rm --name dockagator -v "%cd%:/project" -v "%HomeDrive%%HomePath%/.dockagator:/root/.local/share" gatoreducator/dockagator /bin/bash
```

Here are some additional commands that you may need to run when using Docker:

* `docker info`: display information about how Docker runs on your workstation
* `docker images`: show the Docker images installed on your workstation
* `docker container list`: list the active images running on your workstation
* `docker system prune`: remove many types of "dangling" components from your workstation
* `docker image prune`: remove all "dangling" docker images from your workstation
* `docker container prune`: remove all stopped docker containers from your workstation
* `docker rmi $(docker images -q) --force`: remove all docker images from your workstation

## Interactive Docker Shell Commands

Since the above `docker run` command uses a Docker images that, by default, runs
`gradle grade` and then exits the Docker container, you may want to instead run
the following command so that you enter an "interactive terminal" that will
allow you to repeatedly run commands within the Docker container. Don't forget
that, if you are using the Windows operating system, then you will need to use a
different command to run Docker, as explained previously in this document.
Importantly, the command that you type if you are a Windows user should still
contain the `-it` at the start of the `docker run` and the `/bin/bash` at the
end of the command. However, the other components of this command need to be
customized for the Windows operating system.

If you use either MacOS or Linux, then this is the command that you would run to
enter into the interactive terminal provided by a Docker container:

```bash
docker run -it --rm --name dockagator \
  -v "$(pwd)":/project \
  -v "$HOME/.dockagator":/root/.local/share \
  gatoreducator/dockagator /bin/bash
```

If you use Windows, then this is the command that you would run to enter into
the interactive terminal provided by a Docker container:

```bash
docker run -t --rm --name dockagator \
  -v "%cd%:/project" \
  -v "%HomeDrive%%HomePath%/.dockagator:/root/.local/share" \
  gatoreducator/dockagator /bin/bash
```

Once you have typed this command, you can use the [GatorGrader
tool](https://github.com/GatorEducator/gatorgrader) in the Docker container by
typing the command `gradle grade` in your terminal. Running this command will
produce a lot of output that you should carefully inspect. If GatorGrader's
output shows that there are no mistakes in a course assignment, then your source
code and technical writing are passing all of the automated baseline checks.
However, if the output indicates that there are mistakes, then you will need to
understand what they are and then try to fix them.

Remember, to correctly run any of the commands mentioned in this guide, you must
be in the main (i.e., "home base") directory for a course assignment where the
`build.gradle` file is located.

## Upgrading the Docker Container

If the course instructor provides a new version of the Docker container called
`gatoreducator/dockagator` and you want to receive it immediately, you must
first delete the existing Docker container on your laptop by running the command
`docker rmi gatoreducator/dockagator`. Next, you can re-run one of the
aforementioned Docker commands, like the following one, which would work on
MacOS or Linux:

```
docker run -it --rm --name dockagator \
  -v "$(pwd)":/project \
  -v "$HOME/.dockagator":/root/.local/share \
  gatoreducator/dockagator /bin/bash
```

Please note that if you attempt to run `gradle grade` in an updated Docker
container it is possible that the command will execute incorrectly if you
previously used GatorGrader with a Docker container that featured a different
version of the Python programming language. In this situation, you should delete
the directories inside of the `.dockagator` directory and then again attempt to
run the `gradle grade` command inside of the Docker container. Specifically, you
will need to delete directories in `.dockagator` that are normally called
`gatorgrader`, `virtualenv`, and `virtualenvs`.
